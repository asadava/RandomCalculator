## --- WARNING ---
If one of your numbers has a decimal, then the whole program breaks. Sorry in advance.
![decimals are destructive](https://github.com/asadava/RandomCalculator/blob/main/backtrace.jpg)

A calculator that is, for the most part, random. You put 2 numbers in, and it poops out the numbers, but with a random math equation done to it. Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication, and maybe more in the future.
